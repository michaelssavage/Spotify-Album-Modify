# Spotify-Album-Modify

**Aim**

-   For a user to sign into their Spotify account, view their playlists and replace any songs with the proper album version of that song.
-   Have the option to Replace All or replace individual tracks at a time.

**Example:**

-   The first track shown has an album title that is the same as the track.
-   The second track was released in an album and is the more preferred version that we want.
-   In a playlist, we want to replace instances like the first track with the second track.

**Problem**

-   Check if albums have the same name as the track and can be replaced.
-   Determine if a track correctly has the same name as the album it is in.
-   Replace tracks that are in EPs with albums.
